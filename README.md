# Fragment

This project was created for a **Computer Networks** university course. It combines frontend technologies with conceptual aesthetics using **Three.js**, **GLSL shaders**, and interactive UI logic.

## Conceptual Background

The visual system is inspired by **Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory** of the mind:

- **Id** – primal instincts and hidden drives  
- **Ego** – the rational, conscious self  
- **Superego** – moral reasoning and internalized norms  

As the virtual camera approaches the visual structure, internal patterns emerge or fade — symbolizing the layered nature of consciousness and internal psychological tension.

## Features

-  Real-time GLSL shader
-  Free-fly camera controls for exploration  
-  Lightweight and suitable for browser-based network demos  
- **No mobile support** — desktop only for full functionality
